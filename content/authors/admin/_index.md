Richard Phillips Feynman ForMemRS (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988)
was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral
formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the
physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work
in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For contributions to
the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.
